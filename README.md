# Generating function solution and inference for nuclear-cytoplasmic mRNA counts in a stochastic gene-expression model

This repository contains the Mathematica and Julia codes and data for the paper: [Joint distribution of nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA levels in stochastic models of gene expression: analytical results and parameter inference](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.29.591679v1), where the following stochastic gene-expression model is considered

​                                          $$G\xrightleftharpoons[\sigma_\text{on}]{\sigma_\text{off}}G^*,~~~~~~G\xrightarrow{\rho}G+N,~~~~~~N\xRightarrow{\tau}M,~~~~~~M\xrightarrow{d}\varnothing.$$

Nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNAs are denoted by $N$ and $M$ respectively. $G$ and $G^*$ are the active and inactive gene states respectively. For more details, please refer to the aforementioned paper.

**File description:**

- `Synthetic_data.csv` contains the synthetic data generated by simulating Model I using SSA.
- `PGF_function.jl` and `FSP_function.jl` include the essential functions for parameter inference based on PGF and FSP, respectively. The FSP inference method is modified from the one in [2].
- `Main.jl` includes the main inference steps of the PGF and FSP based methods.
- `model-select.jl` includes Poisson model and Model I model selection using the 10Fold method.
- `taylor_expansion.nb` is the Mathematica code for computing stationary joint distribution of Model I by Taylor expanding the exact generating function solution.
